#+TITLE: LaunchNix Manual


LaunchNix is a program I made that hooks into ~morph~ and Libvirt to easily provision and deploy NixOS VMs. That being said, it's not well-documented, apart from the ~examples/example-deployment.nix~ file, which even then isn't commented and probably won't make sense to most.


There's a preamble and a body, so I'll break up each of them and explain each part.


Preamble:

#+begin_src nix
{
  deployment = {
    # deployment configuration here
  };

  machine = {config, pkgs, lib, ...}: {
    # Machine configuration here
  }
             
}
#+end_src

The ~deployment~ section is where your Libvirt config and "deployment" information goes, and the ~machine~ section is where your NixOS configuration goes.

* Deployment Options
